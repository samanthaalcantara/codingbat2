Question: 
Given three ints, a b c, return True if one of b or c is "close" (differing from a by at most 1), while the other is "far", differing from both other values by 2 or more. Note: abs(num) computes the absolute value of a number
"""


#Answer

def close_far(a, b, c):
  return (abs(abs(b)-abs(c))>=2) and \
  ((abs(abs(b)-abs(a))<=1 and abs(abs(c)-abs(a))>=2) \
  or (abs(abs(c)-abs(a))<=1 and abs(abs(b)-abs(a))>=2))
